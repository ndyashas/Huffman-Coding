# Huffman-Coding
Simple small scale implementation of Huffman encoding and decoding for compression

*NOTE* : the current implimentation is just a direct convertion of the huffman coding algorithm directly into code. Also the encoded message is not written in binary format for the user to understand what exactly happens. Improvements on current implimentations of the convertion and search algorithms is a welcome. 

### Usage
    `$ ./huff.sh yourFile.txt
    `$ ./huffdec.sh table.txt yourEncodedFile.txt
